# Readme for v2.00
This is the 2016, 2017 version of the Slideshow and Cpanel along with other programs. This version uses the $HOME/vendor/bartonlp/site-class programs. The SiteClass is repositoied on http://github.com/bartonlp/site-class.

Version 2.00 is mirrored on my DigitalOcean server at http://www.bartonphillips.org as well as on the main site at 1and1.com http://go.myphotochannel.com.

I have set up the .gitignore to not track any of the file that are server specific (except .htaccess which should work on both sites).
The mysitemap.json, $HOME/vendor, the adscontent/, content/ and other server specific file and directories are not tracked.
